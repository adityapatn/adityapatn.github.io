            <h1>National History Day 2024</h1>
            <p>In 8th grade, I completed an individual National History Day project. I chose to make a documentary about the journey of nuclear power from explosive to electricity to fit that yearâ€™s theme: Turning Points in History. After choosing my topic, I researched the background and history of my topic, why it was a turning point, and its short and long term impacts, as well as how it affects us today. This project was completed over the course of a semester. I presented my project for competition at the East Puget Sound History Day Contest, but I unfortunately did not advance to the state competition. View my documentary below!</p>
