            <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
            <p>I started going to coding classes in 2018, where I learned block-based programming using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/cwkaditya14072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scratch</a>. I also learnt programming in Python by age 12. I have a lot of experience programming in Python, although I still have a lot to learn. I love playing the video game Minecraft, and in 2023 I started dabbling with making Minecraft mods using the programming language Java. At this point I also started learning frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the 2023-2024 school year, I built a program for the VEX V5 Robotics competition in C++, although I am not as comfortable with is as I am with other languages.</p>
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>I learned to use the version control system <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">git</a> early last year. Since then, I have published most of my finished projects on GitHub. You can view the entire history of this website and my other projects as well at my <a href="https://github.com/adityapatn?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub account</a>.</p>
            <h1>Programming Resources</h1>
            <p>I've provided a list below of resources I found super useful as I started programming and especially while I built this website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wNQpDWLs4To?si=C8lfD5DZHky_4FCC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Understanding Frontend Programming</a> - this explanation gave me great context as to how the Internet works, and explains the basics of frontend programming.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/pTB0EiLXUC8?si=co7eoQpD4Gi7dKcy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">What is Object-Oriented Programming?</a> Great tutorial covering the differences between procedural programming and object-oriented programming, as well as the advantages of each one.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/XBu54nfzxAQ?si=HsRV7C-bsHZQmdWM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Understanding Backend Programming</a> This gave me so much insight on how the world's biggest websites work behind the scenes, as well as how clients, servers, and databases communicate.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mosh Hamedani's YouTube Channel</a> - He covers each topic thoroughly and makes it easy to understand with great visuals.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">All of W3Schools</a> - it's a great resource for specific feature tutorials, as well as super helpful documentation for so many languages.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE?si=gYIo7gjry1d7Wn5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">How to Use Git</a> - The best tutorial for beginners I've seen so far explaining version control systems and git syntax.</li>
                <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS Flexbox Layout Guide</a> - this explained CSS display properties really well for me and I refer back to it all the time.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wNQpDWLs4To?si=C8lfD5DZHky_4FCC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">How to Make your Command Line Beautiful</a> - this changed my life. genuinely. It's not only aesthetically pleasing but also gives you useful information (and autofill!)</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Programming Advice</h1>
            <p>First of all, I acknowledge that I'm not the most qualified person to give programming advice. I don't even have a StackOverflow account, so do I really have freedom of speech? That being said, I think this list will be helpful for beginning programmers (don't quit!).</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Search it up.</b> Most of your questions are things other people have asked before. With the advent of the Internet, you quite literally have the world's foremost knowledge at your fingertips. Use it. Using your resources doesn't make you a bad programmer, and helps you learn so much.</li>
                <li><b>Don't copy-paste other people's code.</b> I mean this loosely, but you shouldn't copy an entire program without understanding how it works. Learn how it works, then steal it (I'm joking, don't sue me).</li>
                <li><b>Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials!</b> When you have a specific question, try to go broader and learn more about the subject. Even if you only need to know which command you use to make a new branch using git, covering all the git commands will make you a better programmer.</li>
                <li><b>Don't back away from difficult projects.</b> If there's something you really want to make happen but you don't know how to do it, stick with it! You'll learn so much in the process and it's so satisfying when you finish a project you've been wanting to make for a while. I'm so glad I've learned enough HTML, CSS, and JS to make my own website.</li>
                <li><b>Write it down.</b> When you have a difficult problem you need to solve (specific function in program, algorithm homework, interview question, etc.), write it down first. It's worth the time to think about what exactly you need the program to do and write it down before you start writing the actual program. It'll help clear up the problem and make solving it go faster.</li>
            </ol>
