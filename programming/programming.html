            <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
            <p>I started going to coding classes at the age of 11 (2021), where I learned block-based programming using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/cwkaditya14072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scratch</a>. I also learnt programming in Python by age 12. I have a lot of experience programming in Python, although I still have a lot to learn. I love playing the video game Minecraft, and in 2023 I started dabbling with making Minecraft mods using the programming language Java. At this point I also started learning frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the 2023-2024 school year, I built a program for the VEX V5 Robotics competition in C++, although I am not as comfortable with is as I am with other languages.</p>
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>I learned to use the version control system <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git</a> early last year. Since then, I have published most of my finished projects on GitHub. You can view the entire history of this website and my other projects as well at my <a href="https://github.com/adityapatn?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub account</a>.</p>
