            <h1>2023-2024 VEX Robotics: Over Under</h1>
            <p>I competed on a team for the VEX Robotics Competition Over Under Season in 2023 and 2024. Starting from October 2023, I devoted about ten hours a week with my team in order to design, program, and build a robot for competition. We iterated through several designs over the course of the season. My main job on the team was to make the program to run the robot, although I also assisted with designing and building the bot. I built the entire robot program in Visual Studio Code using C++. We competed at various tournaments, such as the Ignite Robotics Signature Event, Blaze Triball Matchup, and Blaze Middle School League. Our hard work culminated at the Washington State Middle School Championships in March 2024, where we played well but unfortunately did advance to the VEX Worlds competition.</p>
            <h1>2024-2025 VEX Robotics: High Stakes</h1>
            <p>I'm currently on Team 10E Exothermic Eclipse in Washington. I spend 8-10 hours weekly working on either building the robot, making the program, or documenting our design process. I am a programmer and notebooker on our team. I'll update this section as the season progresses. Good luck to the other teams out there!</p>
